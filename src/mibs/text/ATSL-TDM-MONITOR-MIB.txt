    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module defines configuration fields and tables required for 
         result retrieval from a generic TDM monitor. The TDM monitor is
         independent of any frame structure, line code or transmission speed.
         Currently, the TDM monitor collects three different sets of results:
         analog line resuls (frequency, level), performance tests based on
         anomaly and defect detection and latency.

         The 'tdmMonitor' does not supply any resource required to configure
         the TDM signal or frame structure in the agent and assumes this
         configuration as something given. It follows a list with the Scalars
         and tables defined by the MIB:

         Scalars

        - 'tdmMonEnable': Starts / Stops network monitoring in the managed
          entity. The action starts monitoring in all the available blocks. The
          number of monitoring blocks may not be the same for different managed
          entities and it may be that there is only one monitoring block for
          some of them.

        - 'tdmMonPerformanceStandard': Configures the ITU-T performance standard
          to be used in the next monitoring session. This MIB module supports
          setting of three different performance standards on the managed
          entity: ITU-T G.821, ITU-T G.826 and ITU-T M.2100.

        - 'tdmMonDelayEnable': Enables ('true') / Disables ('false') the latency 
          test in the current monitoring session. This test  measures the 
          propagation delay experienced by the transmitted data over a network  
          path. To get a result it is necessary a previous configuration of a
          valid test pattern in the transmitter and the receiver. No delay
          result is available if the receiver detects a Loss of Sequence
          Synchronization (LSS). The 'tdmMonDelayEnable' control cannot be 
          modified if there is an ongoing monitoring session previously enabled 
          with 'tdmMonEnable'.

        - 'tdmMonDelayRtdOffset': Configures a fixed time offset for the RTD 
          test in milliseconds. The value configured in this field is 
          substracted from the latency result before being presented to the 
          user. The 'tdmMonDelayRtdOffset' can be used to remove the effect of 
          known delays from the RTD test result.

        - 'tdmMonRtdOffsetAdjust': Configures the current RTD test result as a
          fixed offset in the 'tdmMonRtdOffset' field. Adjusting zero offset is
          used to calibrate the tester for RTD tests and remove the effects of
          patch cables and other elements from the result.

         Tables

        - 'tdmMonLineTable': This table includes information about test results
          that do not depend on any particular frame structure. These analogue
          test results are related with frequency and attenuation. Some results
          in this table are always available (it is not necessary to start a
          monitoring session to get the metric value). These are instant
          results, like the instantaneous value of the line frequency or
          attenuation, that do not correspond with statistics computed over a
          finite time period.

        - 'tdmMonPerformanceTable': This table contains details about standard
          performance tests defined by the ITU-T to be applied to different TDM
          interfaces. Performance testing extend the ability of a basic BER
          based on simple computation of bit errors to rate a TDM link or path.
          The performance standards define metrics that go beyond the bit error
          like for example the errored second, severely errored second or
          background block error.

        - 'tdmMonRtdTable': The round trip delay monitoring table contains
          details about latency tests carried in one or several test interfaces
          in the agent. This rount trip delay monitoring has to be enabled by
          means the 'tdmMonRtdEnable' control. The 'tdmMonRtdEnable' control is
          independent of the monitoring session start / stop control. Some test
          results in this table require both of them bo be enabled.

        ALBEDO Telecom testers currently implementing this MIB module are
        listed below:

        - AT-2048 E1 / Datacom Tester.
        - Ether.Genius GbE / E1 / Datacom / Jitter & Wander Tester."
    REVISION     "201707200000Z" -- 20 July, 2017
    DESCRIPTION
        "- 'tdmRtdTable' together with the 'tdmMonRtdEnable', 'tdmMonRtdOffset' 
           and 'tdmMonRtdOffsetAdjust' OIDs become deprecated.
         - The'rtdTestStatus' textual convention is renamed to 'delayTestSatus'.
         - The 'tdmMonRtdEnable' scalar is renamed to 'tdmMonDelayEnable'.
         - The 'tdmMonRtdOffset' scalar is renamed to 'tdmMonDelayRtdOffset' 
           and two new scalars are defined: 'tdmMonDelayForwardOffset' and 
           'tdmMonDelayReverseOffset'.
         - The 'tdmMonRtdOffsetAdjust'scalar is renamed to 
           'tdmMonDelayOffsetAdjust' and its definition is modified so that now 
           it accepts three configuration values: 'ready', 'adjust' and 'off'.
         - A new scalar is defined 'tdmMonLatencyMode'."

TdmPerformanceStandard ::=TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "ITU-T Standard associated to performance tests in TDM paths. The ITU-T
         performance standard specify metrics such as the Errored Second (ES)
         and the Severely Errored Second (SES) and define the mechanisms
         required to measure these metrics in TDM links operating at different
         speeds above or below the primary rate. The supported values of the
         performance standard test convention are listed below:

         - 'g821' (ITU-T G.821): This standard was released for first time in
           1980 to be used in digital links operating at rates below 2048 kb/s.
           At the time ITU-T G.821 was defined, an standard for links operating
           at 2048 kb/s and higher was not available. This is the reason because
           for some time, this ITU-T Recommendation was used in a very wide
           class of connections.

         - 'g826' (ITU-T G.826): It was released in 1983 for performance
           assessment of links operating at 2048 kb/s and above. Performance
           metrics defined in this standard are based on the concept of block (a
           group of consecutive bits).

         - 'm2100' (ITU-T M.2100): This ITU-T Recommendation provides
           performance limits for bringing-into-service and maintenance PDH
           paths and connections. While the G-series Recommendations define
           long-term performance objectives to be met, M.2100 and other M-series
           Recommendations are intended to assure that the long-term
           requirements of the G-series are met in every cas. For this reason
           the requirements of the M-series are tougher than those on the
           G-series. An specific feature of M.2100 is that it allows shorter
           test intervals than ITU-T G.821 and G.826.

         To the 'g821', 'g826' y 'm2100' values, is to be added the 'none'
         value, which enables controlling entities to use the current textual
         convention to not select any performance test standards."

DelayTestStatus ::=TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Represents the possible test status of a delay test carried out in a 
         TDM interface. The latency test in these interfaces is based on special 
         marks carried within a test pattern. Receiving unexpected test pattern 
         or a valid test pattern without the correct latency measurement marks 
         makes any delay computation impossible.

         Some of the delay test status are temporary conditions, some are error
         conditions and some others indicate that the test result is correct.
         These are the currently supported values for variables using the
         'DelayTestStatus' textual convention:

         - 'idle': The RTD test result is not active.

         - 'done': The RTD test result is correct. The receiver has detected a
           valid test pattern in the incomming signal and there are enough
           latency computing marks to calculate the RTD.

         - 'acquiring': This is a temporary test status that indicates that
           the analyser is still searching for a valid test patern with latency
           measurement marks.

         - 'timeout': The latency test has failed because the receiver has been
           unable to find a correct test pattern and latency measurement marks.

         - 'nodata': The latency test has failed because the receiver has 
           not detected measurement marks from the remote unit.

         - 'sync': The latency test has failed because the reference clock
           of the unit is not properly synchronized although it is declared
           as synchronized. This situation is detected when the measured delay
           is negative.

         - 'lsync': The latency test has failed because the reference clock
           of the unit has not synchronized to an external reference source
           such as the GPS/PPS.

         - 'rsync': The latency test has failed because the remote unit
           reports that its reference clock has not synchronized to an
           external reference source such as the GPS/PPS.

         - 'loop': The one-way latency test has failed because the unit has
           received measurement marks from itself, not from a different
           unit.

         - 'noloop': The round-trip latency test has failed because the unit has
           received measurement marks from a different unit, not from
           itself.

         - 'error': The latency test has failed because the remote unit has
           received incorrect measurement marks.
           
         - 'uncal': Delay offset calibration could not be achieved.
         
         - 'rvers': The one-way latency test has failed because the units 
           are running different protocol versions."
