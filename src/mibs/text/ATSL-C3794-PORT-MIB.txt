    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB defines configuration fields and tables required for
         configuration of IEEE C37.94 ports in Albedo Telecom SNMP agents.

         The IEEE C37.94 standard constitutes a communications interface for 
         interconnection of power protection equipment (protection relays) and 
         transmission equipment using two MMFs. This communications standard 
         enables transmission of N x 64 kb/s (with N ranging between 1 and 12) 
         to distances up to 2 km.

         The bit rate corresponding to N=1 is 64 kb/s. The bit rate 
         corresponding to N=12 is 768 kb/s. Optical transmission is used to 
         guarantee reliable transmission within the substation environment
         where the IEEE C37.94 is designed to operate. This environment is 
         characterized by a high level of electromagnetic perturbations caused 
         by high voltages and currents in power lines. Specially during fault
         conditions the perturbation level can rise significantly and disturb 
         communications channels based on copper wires.

         The IEEE C37.94 frame closely resembles the structure of an ITU-T
         G.703 2048 kb/s signal but it defines a framing structure prepared for
         conveying a single variable rate channel rather than various 64 kb/s
         multiplexed channels.

         Scalars

         - 'c3794PortEnable': Starts / Stops traffic generation in the managed 
           entity. The action starts generation through all the available 
           blocks. The number of monitoring blocks may not be the same for 
           different managed entities and it may be that there is only one 
           monitoring block for some of them.

         Tables

         - 'c3794PortLineTable': Configures settings related with the IEEE 
           C37.94 transmission media and optical layer communications. 
           Basically, this table enables or disables the optical transmitter 
           for safery reasons and it controls the transmitted clock source.

         - 'c3794PortFrameTable': Sets the IEEE C37.94 frame. It enables the 
           user to choose between unframed transmission or to enable the frame 
           structure defined in the IEEE C37.94 standards. It also configures 
           the bit rate in the payload area in transmitted frames. This payload 
           is an integer multiple of 64 kb/s ranging between 64 kb/s and
           768 kb/s.
