    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB defines configuration fields and tables required for
         configuration of a 2048 kb/s E1 test port. The E1 signal description is
         included in standard ITU-T G.703. Frame structures used in this MIB are
         defined in ITU-T G.704 standard.

         The E1 frame defines a cyclical set of 32 time slots of 8 bits. The
         time slot 0 is devoted to transmission management and time slot 16 for
         signalling; the rest were assigned originally for voice/data transport.

         Scalars

         - 'e1PortEnable': Starts / Stops traffic generation in the managed
           entity. The action starts generation through all the available
           blocks. The number of monitoring blocks may not be the same for
           different managed entities and it may be that there is only one
           monitoring block for some of them.

         - 'e1AddDropSource': Some agents can be configured to add / drop E1
           time slot to / from an external datacom or G.703 64 kb/s interface.
           To do that, the agent has to be configured either in E1 endpoint or
           E1 monitor mode and the external interface has to be properly
           configured. It is also required to select the port to be used to add
           / drop time slots. To do that the 'e1AddDropSource' OID has to be
           configured in the agent to either 'datacom' or 'g703e0'.

         - 'e1AudioOutputSource': Some agents have the capability to add / drop
           time slots from / to an analogue port. The agent is able to encode
           the audio signal from the microphone and add it to the 2048 kb/s
           frame or to drop a selected time slot to a speaker connected to the
           audio port. In this case, it may be necessary to configure the origin
           of the signal to be sent to the speaker.

         Tables

         - 'e1PortLineTable': The 'tdmPortLineTable' table configures some of
           the basic physical operation parameters for TDM transmission and
           reception. Some of these include the connector, line code, bit rate
           and the clock source. Some of these settings may be relevant only for
           a subset of the supported interfaces. For example, E1 interfaces are
           not allowed to work at bit rates other than 2048 kb/s.

         - 'e1PortFrameTable': E1 agents with traffic generation capabilities
           may generate different kinds of 2048 kb/s framed and unframed
           signals. This table provides the resources required to configure
           frame structure and content. E1 Communication consist on continuous
           transmission of frames consisting on 32 time slots of 8 bits each.
           Frame synchronization is achieved by sending an indication showing
           the position of the first time interval of each frame, so that, since
           the receiver knows to which channel the information in each time slot
           corresponds, it can demultiplex correctly. This way, the bytes
           received in each slot are assigned to the correct channel.

         - 'e1PortMuxTable': This table includes 32 rows, one for each time slot
           present in the E1 frame. For each time slot the table specifies a
           particular data source, including internally or externally generated
           data..

         - 'e1PortDemuxTable': This table includes 32 rows, one for each time
           slot present in the E1 frame. For each time slot the table specifies
           a particular data sink, including internal analysis blocks or
           external destinations.

         - 'e1PortCasTable': This table contains configuration of the Channel
           Association Signalling (CAS) multiframe. As well as transmitting
           information generated by the users of a telephone network, it is also
           necessary to transmit signalling information. CAS signalling refers
           to the protocols that must be established between exchanges so that
           the users can exchange information one each other.

         - 'e1PortNfasTable': This table configures the Non-Frame Alignment
           Signal (NFAS) defined in E1 frames with CRC-4 multiframe structure.
           The NFAS is made up of the the bits of the TS0 that do not contain
           the FAS in positions 3 to 8. This signal is sent in alternate frames
           (frame 1, frame 3, frame 5, etc.).

    REVISION     "201609200000Z" -- 20 September, 2016
    DESCRIPTION
        "The 'TimeSlotUse' and 'ABCD' textual conventions are removed from this
         MIB definition. These textual conventions are now included in
         ATSL-TDM-PORT-MIB. 'TimeSlotUse' and 'ABCD' are now added to the import
         list from the 'ATSL-TDM-PORT-MIB' module.

         The 'e1PortModeTable' is not supported any more from this MIB.
         the equivalent functionality is now provided from the
         'ATSL-TDM-PORT-MIB' through the 'tdmPortModeTable'"
    REVISION     "201602050000Z" -- 5 February, 2016
    DESCRIPTION
        "The 'FrameType' textual convention is removed from this MIB definition.
         'FrameType' is now included in ATSL-TDM-PORT-MIB. 'FrameType' is now
         added to the import list from the 'ATSL-TDM-PORT-MIB' module."
    REVISION     "201412230000Z" -- 23 December, 2014
    DESCRIPTION
        "The 'tdmPortModeTable' and 'tdmPortLineTable' have been imported from
         the ATSL-TDM-PORT-MIB with the names 'e1PortModeTable' and
         'e1PortLineTable'.

         Some fields in the 'e1PortLineTable' have been deleted or customized
         for ITU-T G.703 interfaces only (not Datacom, like in previous
         versions): 'e1PortLineRateMultiplier', 'e1PortLineRateUser' are
         deleted, 'e1PortLineRate' is modified. 'e1PortLineE0Interface' and
         'e1PortLineE0ClockRole' are new OIDs added in this version of the
         MIB."

    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB name has been changed to 'ATSL-E1-PORT-MIB.txt' from
         'ATSL-E1-GENERATOR-MIB.txt'. Module identity has changed to 'e1Port'.
         OID prefixes and comments have been upgraded to match the new
         terminology.

         The structure corresponding to the 'e1PortNfasTable' has changed. The
         previous implementation based on a triple index approach has changed to
         a double index structure: 'e1PortNfasIndexBlock' and
         'e1PortNfasIndexFrame'."

    DESCRIPTION
        "E1 agents with traffic generation capabilities may generate different
         kinds of 2048 kb/s framed and unframed signals. This table provides the
         resources required to configure frame structure and content.

         E1 Communication consist on continuous transmission of frames
         consisting on 32 time slots of 8 bits each. Frame synchronization is
         achieved by sending an indication showing the position of the first
         time interval of each frame, so that, since the receiver knows to which
         channel the information in each time slot corresponds, it can
         demultiplex correctly. This way, the bytes received in each slot are
         assigned to the correct channel.

         E1 frames may optionally include a CRC-4 code in the first time slot
         (TS0). The CRC-4 reports the occurrence of one or more bit errors in a
         specific group of data. The CRC-4 also prevents loss of synchronization
         due to the coincidental appearance of the sequence '0011011' in a time
         slot other than the TS0.

         Call signalling in E1 systems may be based in different mechanisms. One
         of them is the Channel Associated Signalling (CAS). In CAS signalling,
         a signalling channel is associated with each information channel (there
         is no common signalling channel), meaning that the signalling circuits
         are personalized for each time slot."

e1PortCasTable OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX            SEQUENCE OF E1PortCasEntry
    MAX-ACCESS        not-accessible
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table contains configuration of the Channel Association Signalling
         (CAS) multiframe.  There is one 'e1PortCasTable' for each test port.
         Tables are distinguished through the value of 'e1PortFrameIndex'.
         This index is also used to tie the 'e1PortCasTable' to an specific row
         of the 'e1PortFrameTable'. 

         As well as transmitting information generated by the users of a 
         telephone network, it is also necessary to transmit signalling
         information. Signalling refers to the protocols that must be
         established between exchanges so that the users can exchange
         information one each other. There are signals that indicate when a
         subscriber has picked up the telephone, when he or she can start to
         dial a number, and when another subscriber calls, and so on. The CAS
         signalling mechanism is defined in the ITU-T Recommendation G.704,
         which defines the structure of the E1 frame.

         In CAS signalling, a signalling channel is associated with each
         information channel (there is no common signalling channel), meaning
         that the signalling circuits are personalized for each channel. CAS
         assigns to each 64 kb/s telephone channel a 2 kb/s for signalling. This
         signalling is formed by a word of 4 bits (generically known as A, B, C,
         and D) that is situated in the TS16 of all the frames sent. Each TS16
         therefore carries the signalling for two telephone channels.

         Given that there are only four signalling bits available for each
         channel, to transmit all the signalling words from the 30 PCM channels
         that make up a 2048 kb/s frame, it is necessary to wait until the TS16
         of 15 consecutive frames have been received. The grouping of frames
         defines a CAS signalling multiframe, which consists of a set of the
         TS16 of 16 consecutive E1 frames.

         Configuration of this table does not make sense if the frame structure
         does not have a CAS multiframe ('e1PortFrameTxStructure' is configured
         to 'pcm30' or 'pcm30c'."

    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table configures the Non-Frame Alignment Signal (NFAS) defined
         in E1 frames with CRC-4 multiframe structure. There is one
         'e1PortNfasTable' for each test port. Tables are distinguished through
         the value of 'e1PortFrameIndex'. This index is also used to tie the
         'e1PortNfasTable' to an specific row of the 'e1PortFrameTable'.

         The NFAS is made up of the bits of the TS0 that do not contain the
         FAS in positions 3 to 8. This signal is sent in alternate frames
         (frame 1, frame 3, frame 5, etc.).

         The first bit of the NFAS (bit 3 of the TS0) is used to indicate that
         an alarm has occurred at the far end of the communication. When
         operating normally, it is set to '0,' while a value of '1' indicates
         an alarm. The bits in positions 4 to 8 are spare bits, and they do not
         have one single application, but can be used in a number of ways, as
         decided by the telecommunications carrier. In accordance with the ITU-T
         Recommendation G.704, these bits can be used in specific point-to-point
         applications, or to establish a data link based on messages for
         operations management, maintenance or monitoring of the transmission
         quality, and so on. If these spare bits in the NFAS are not used, they
         must be set to '1' in international links.

         does not have a CRC-4 multiframe ('e1PortFrameTxStructure' is configured
