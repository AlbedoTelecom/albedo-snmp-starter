    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB defines configuration fields and tables required for
         configuration of a 1544 kb/s T1 test port. The T1 signal description is
         included in standard ANSI T1-102-1999. Frame structures used in this 
         MIB are defined in ANSI T1-403-1999 standard.

         The T1 frame defines a cyclical set of 24 time slots of 8 bits. There
         is an additional bit used for framing. The total amount of bits in
         a T1 frame is therefore 193. Depending on the specific frame type the 
         T1 frame may contain structures. The ESF frame defines a multiframe 
         structure that enables error detection in the far end. There is also 
         the possibility to use one bit in each time slot to carry signalling
         information.

         Scalars

         - 't1PortEnable': Starts / Stops traffic generation in the managed 
           entity. The action starts generation through all the available 
           blocks. The number of monitoring blocks may not be the same for 
           different managed entities and it may be that there is only one 
           monitoring block for some of them.

         - 't1AddDropSource': Some agents can be configured to add / drop T1 
           timeslots to / from an external datacom or G.703 64 kb/s interface. 
           To do that, the agent has to be configured either in 'TDM endpoint' 
           or 'TDM monitor' mode and the external interface has to be properly 
           configured. It is also required to select the port to be used to add 
           / drop time slots. To do that the 't1AddDropSource' OID has to be 
           configured in the agent to either 'datacom' or 'g703e0'.

         - 't1AudioOutputSource': Some agents have the capability to add / drop 
           time slots from / to an analogue port. The agent is able to encode 
           the audio signal from the microphone and add it to the 1544 kb/s 
           frame or to drop a selected time slot to a speaker connected to the 
           audio port. In this case, it may be necessary to configure the origin 
           of the signal to be sent to the speaker.

         Tables

         - 't1PortLineTable': The 't1PortLineTable' table configures some of the 
           basic physical operation parameters for T1 transmission and 
           reception. Some of these include the connector, line code, bit rate 
           and the clock source.

         - 't1PortFrameTable': T1 agents with traffic generation capabilities 
           may generate different kinds of 1544 kb/s framed and unframed 
           signals. This table provides the resources required to configure 
           frame structure and content. T1 Communication consist on continuous  
           transmission of frames consisting on 24 time slots of 8 bits each. 
           There is an additional framing bit that is inserted in every frame. 
           The T1 frame is therefore made up of 24 x 8 + 1 bits. The same 
           structure is repeated with a period of 125 microseconds which gives a 
           transmission rate of 1544 kb/s.

         - 't1PortMuxTable':The 't1PortMuxTable' includes 24 rows, one for each 
           time slot present in the T1 frame. For each time slot the table 
           specifies a particular data source, including internally or 
           externally generated data.

         - 't1PortDemuxTable': The 't1PortDemuxTable' includes 24 rows, one for 
           each time slot present in the T1 frame. For each time slot the table 
           specifies a particular data sink, including internal analysis blocks 
           or external destinations.

           with the nominal impedance (75 Ohm for the unbalanced port and 
           120 Ohm for the balanced one). The expected attenuation is the
           theoretical cable attenuation which increases with the frequency
           square root.

           point that is isolated from the network and it is specially suited
           for monitoring purposes. A flat attenuation of 20 dB is expected for
           these points.

         - 'monitor25db': 25 dB protected monitoring point. This is a connection
           point that is isolated from the network and it is specially suited
           for monitoring purposes. A flat attenuation of 25 dB is expected for
           these points.

         - 'monitor30db': 30 dB protected monitoring point. This is a connection
           point that is isolated form the network and it is specially suited
           for monitoring purposes. A flat attenuation of 30 dB is expected for
           these points.

         T1 frames (ESF frame) may optionally include a CRC-6 code to report 
         the occurrence of one or more bit errors in a specific group of data 
         or a facilities data link which provides a operations, management and 
         maintenance channel.

         Call signalling in T1 systems may be based in different mechanisms. One
         of them is the Channel Associated Signalling (CAS). In CAS signalling,
         a signalling channel is associated with each information channel (there
         is no common signalling channel), meaning that the signalling circuits
         are personalized for each time slot. In T1 systems, the CAS signalling 
         is implemented through the 'robbed bit' mechanism"
