    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB contains the OID required to retrieve status information and
         performance statistics from generic data communication interfaces.
         Supported interfaces include V.24 / V.28 (synchronous and
         asynchronous), X.21 / V.11, V.35, V.36, EIA-530 and EIA-530A but
         the same MIB could probably be used for other interfaces without
         modification.
         
         All datacom interfaces share a common reference level. There are two
         different device types, the Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) is the
         termination equipment. It generates and receives data. On the other
         hand, the Data Communications Equipment is the transmission equipment
         in charge of encoding the information for long reach data transmission.
         
         ---------        ---------                   ---------        ---------
         |  DTE  |<------>|  DCE  |<--------//------->|  DCE  |<------>|  DTE  |
         ---------        ---------                   ---------        ---------

         This MIB also supports the G.703 co-directional interface because
         this is implemented as a datacom interface in some ALBEDO SNMP
         agents.  This interface does not share the DTE / DCE reference
         model with other datacom standards.

         The scalar OIDs and tables defined in this module are listed below:

         Scalars

         - 'dataMonControl': Starts / Stops network monitoring in the managed
           entity. The action starts monitoring in all the avaialble blocks.
           The number of monitoring blocks may not be the same for different
           managed entities and it may be that there is only one monitoring
           block for some of them. 

         Tables

         - 'dataMonAnomalies': Table that stores information about anomalies
           recorded in a datacom link. An anomaly is defined as the smallest
           discrepancy which can be observed between the actual and desired
           characteristics in the data structure or content. The occurrence
           of a single anomaly does not constitute an interruption in the
           ability to perform a required function but it may involve temporary
           transmission performance degradation.

         - 'dataMonDefects': This is a table that contains information about
           defects declared in data communications signals received by the agent
           test ports. A defect is declared when the density of anomalies has
           reached a level where the ability to perform a required function has
           been interrupted. Defects are usually persistent indication of a
           fault that clear only when the triggering condition has been
           resolved.

         - 'dataMonCircuitMap': This table contains the circuit map for the
           currently enabled data communication interfaces. The circuit map
           could be used to display real time or nearly real time status
           information about datacom circuits. The information available in the
           table includes both state and activity. State is supplied through an
           'on' / 'off' (or 'zero' / 'one') result. Activity is reported by
           means an 'idle' / 'active' result.

        ALBEDO Telecom testers currently implementing this MIB module are listed
        below:

        - AT-2048 E1 / Datacom Tester.
        - AT.One T1 / E1 / Datacom Tester.
