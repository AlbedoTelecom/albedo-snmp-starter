    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB defines basic tools required to run a synchronization test in 
         Albedo SNMP agents supporting this kind of test. The MIB is oriented 
         to configure the tests themselves and not the interfaces where the 
         tests are to be run.

         Tables and scalars defined here are conceived to be compatible with 
         synchronization tests running over E1, T1, Ethernet and IEEE 1588 / 
         PTP interfaces. Jitter, wander and other more specialized tests (FPP, 
         time error, etc.). There is one limitation in the results provided, 
         however. All results depending specifically on the protocol or
         interface where the test runs require their own MIB. For example, no 
         counts for the different message types used by the PTP protocol are 
         supplied by this MIB. It is understood that a PTP results MIB with 
         this purpose exists

         Two other important topics not covered by this MIB but required to run 
         the synchronization tests are listed below:

         1. Clock reference inputs and outputs. This MIB assumes that the clock 
            reference is configured before the test is done. Some special MIB is 
            required to do this operation. Jitter tests do not require an 
            external reference and therefore this requirement is not so 
            important for these kind of tests.

         2. The IEEE 1588 / PTP protocol has be configured before any test    
            could be run over this interface. This protocol has special settings 
            and controls and it requires an specific PTP configuration MIB that 
            is out of the scope of this module.

         3. Phase impairment generation is not covered by this MIB and it is 
            also expected that a MIB specifically conceived for this purpose 
            is able to carry out this task.

         This MIB module is made up of several scalars and configuration / 
         results tables. The current MIB module provides support of the 
         following components:

         Scalars

         - 'syncMonitorRun': Starts / Stops all currently configured
           synchronization tests in all instances in the managed entity. The
           number of monitoring instances may not be the same in different
           managed entities. Some agents may have one single synchronization
           test instance while others may support several simultaneous
           instances. The instance number may also depend on how the managed
           entity is configured.

         Tables

         - 'syncMonitorWanderSettingsTable': Configures and runs a wander test 
           in the managed entity. Wander in a digital signal is defined as a 
           slow  phase fluctuation that degrades the quality of the clock 
           embedded in the signal. The upper limit to the wander frequency band 
           is usually defined to be 10 Hz but wander could have periods of hours 
           or even days. Wander is propagated through the network and because it 
           is not absorbed or filtered, it is accumulated thus impairing the 
           timing signal. This concept of phase fluctuation could be translated 
           without relevant modifications to synchronization protocols for 
           packet switched networks such as PTP / IEEE 1588v2. Measuring wander 
           to assess the long term stability of a timing signal involves the use 
           of an accurate clock reference due to the inability to filter out 
           wander components from the signal under test. The phase of the 
           reference clock is then compared with the phase corresponding  to the 
           signal under test. Performance metrics are then derived from the 
           phase error. 

         - 'syncMonitorFPPSettingsTable': Configures and runs a Floor Delay 
           Population test in the managed entity. The floor delay population 
           test attempts to implement a mechanism to measure the number of 
           samples suitable for slave synchronization. With this objective in 
           mind, the test defines an acceptable end-to-end delay range. The 
           lowest delay is defined to be the floor delay for the path under 
           test. In other words, the smallest time recorded for a packet as it 
           is transmitted through the path. The highest delay is obtained by 
           adding a fixed time to the floor delay.  Samples are rated as 
           conforming if they are found between the minimum and the maximum 
           delay. Not conforming packets exhibit an end-to-end  delay larger 
           than the maximum. By definition, there are no packets with end-to-end 
           delay below the floor delay.

         - 'syncMonitorJitterSettingsTable': Configures a jitter test in the 
           managed entity. Jitter is defined as short-term variations of the 
           significant instants of a digital signal from their reference 
           positions in time. In other words, it is a phase oscillation with a 
           frequency higher than 10 Hz. Jitter causes sampling errors and 
           provokes slips in the phase-locked loops (PLL) buffers. The 
           parameters that characterize the jitter of a digital signal are    
           amplitude and frequency. The amplitude quantifies the extent to 
           which a significant instant deviates from its nominal reference 
           position. The frequency tells us how quickly this significant instant 
           is moving relative to its ideal position in time.

         - 'syncMonitorPhaseAnalysisTable': This table accounts for different 
           performance parameters used to evaluate the synchronization quality  
           in circuit and packet switched networks. The main references for the 
           metrics reported by this table are ITU-T G.810 for generic 
           performance metrics and ITU-T G.8260 for metrics specifically defined 
           for packet switched networks. Performance of both frequency 
           distribution deployments (frequency offset, frequency drift, TIE) and 
           phase distribuiton deployments (TE, constant TE, dynamic TE) is 
           covered. Maximum and minimum statistics are given when necessary to 
           help the controlling unit to keep control of the variation ranges 
           corresponding to the given metrics.

         - 'syncMonitorWanderAnalysisTable': Reports wander test results in the 
           managed entity. Each row in the table represents the wander results 
           for an specific observation window. Moreover, results could be 
           referred to different testing blocks or instances. For this reason, 
           the table has a double index structure. The same results table 
           applies both to circuit and packet interfaces. In results referred 
           to packet interfaces is to be understood that the 'TIE', 'MTIE' and 
           'TDEV' results represent the equivalent metrics for these kind of 
           interfaces: 'pktFilteredTIE', 'pktFilteredMTIE' and 
           'pktFilteredTDEV'.

         - 'syncMonitorFPPAnalysisTable': The floor delay population test 
           attempts to implement a mechanism to measure the number of samples 
           suitable for slave synchronization. With this objective in mind, the 
           test defines an acceptable end-to-end delay range. The lowest delay 
           is defined to be the floor delay for the path under test. In other 
           words, the smallest time recorded for a packet as it is transmitted 
           through the path. The highest delay is obtained by adding a fixed 
           time to the floor delay. Samples are rated as conforming if they are 
           found between the minimum and the maximum delay. Not conforming 
           packets exhibit an end-to-end delay larger than the maximum. By 
           definition, there are no packets with end-to-end delay below 
           the floor delay.

         - 'syncMonitorJitterAnalysisTable': This table contains information 
           about jitter test results computed by the agent. The purpose of the 
           jitter test is to obtain the jitter amplitude (expressed in UIs) 
           present at the output port of a specific network equipment in certain 
           frequency bands. The ITU-T specifies and limits the maximum amount of 
           jitter allowed in a network. In particular, ITU-T G.825 (SDH) and 
           G.823 (PDH), and Telcordia GR-253 (SONET) and GR-499 (T-carrier), 
           limit the maximum amount of jitter in network equipment output ports. 
           This output jitter may be generated by the equipment itself, or may 
           result from the transfer of jitter from one of the inputs of the 
           element, either the data input or the synchronization input. The 
           result of the measurement is the jitter amplitude in a specific 
           bandwidth, specified by the above-mentioned recommendations for each 
           rate in the PDH and SDH hierarchies. 

         Should we wish to measure  the jitter generated by the NE, we need to 
         connect an input signal free of jitter.

        "Configures one of the packet selection method to be used to filter PTP 
         samples to compute wander performance metrics. The selection method 
         configured in this field constitutes a non linear filter applied to 
         the timing input before it is transferred to the wander metric 
         calculation block. This filtering is used to discard samples and avoid 
         unrealistic wander results. For example the filter could be used to 
         discard packets with potentially large delay variation. The selection 
         methods supported by the test units are defined in ITU-T G.8260 and 
         they are listed below:

         - 'minimum': Selects the packet with smaller end-to-end delay within 
           the filtering window.

         - 'maximum': Selects the packet with larger end-to-end delay within 
           the filtering window.

         - 'percentile': Uses a percentile value expressed in % to configure 
           the packets to be processed by the MTIE / TDEV block 
           ('syncMonitorWanderSettingsPercentileMax'). Packets with an 
           end-to-end delay larger than the configured percentile are not taken 
           into account.

         - 'band': Uses two percentile values expressed in % to configure the 
           packets to be processed by the MTIE / TDEV block. These percentiles 
           are configured through the 'syncMonitorWanderSettingsPercentileMin' 
           and 'syncMonitorWanderSettingsPercentileMax' OID. Samples with a 
           delay smaller than the minimum percentile or larger than maximum
           percentile are ignored by the MTIE / TDEV processing block.

         This OID is to be configured only in tests based on the 
         'pktFilteredTIE', 'pktFilteredMTIE' and 'pktFilteredTDEV' metrics 
         such as those for IEEE 1588-2008 / PTP packet interfaces."

        "Window length expressed in seconds for the linear filtering processing 
         block placed before the MTIE and TDEV block. Unlike the selection 
         filter, the linear filtering operates by averaging sample values 
         before they are used to compute the MTIE and TDEV values. With this 
         operation, it is pretended to simulate the behaviour of a real timing 
         synchronization circuit that always tends to average the samples on 
         its input.

         The BW filter window length is subject to the same kind of trade off 
         that than the selection window. The longer the window the more 
         accurate results but longer windows involve longer test periods as 
         well.

         the floor delay for the path under test. In other words, the smallest 
         time recorded for a packet as it is transmitted through the path. The 
         highest delay is obtained by adding a fixed time to the floor delay. 
         Samples are rated as conforming if they are found between the minimum 
         and the maximum delay. Not conforming packets exhibit an end-to-end 
         delay larger than the maximum. By definition, there are no packets

    DESCRIPTION
        "This table contains information about jitter test results computed by 
         the agent. The purpose of the jitter test is to obtain the jitter 
         amplitude (expressed in UIs) present at the output port of a 
         specific network equipment in certain frequency bands. The ITU-T 
         specifies and limits the maximum amount of jitter allowed in a 
         network. In particular, ITU-T G.825 (SDH) and G.823 (PDH), and 
         Telcordia GR-253 (SONET) and GR-499 (T-carrier), limit the maximum 
         amount of jitter in network equipment output ports. This output jitter 
         may be generated by the equipment itself, or may result from the 
         transfer of jitter from one of the inputs of the element, either the 
         data input or the synchronization input. The result of the measurement 
         is the jitter amplitude in a specific bandwidth, specified by the 
         above-mentioned recommendations for each rate in the PDH and 
         SDH hierarchies. 

         Should we wish to measure  the jitter generated by the NE, we need to 
         connect an input signal free of jitter."
