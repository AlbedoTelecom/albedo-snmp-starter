    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB contains definition of objects required by Ethernet / IP / UDP
         test ports to generate traffic. Some of the settings described here
         may be applied to the receiver as well.

         Scalars

         - 'psnGenEnable': Starts / Stops frame generation in the managed
           entity. The action starts traffic generation in all the available
           blocks. The number of generation blocks may not be the same for
           different managed entities and it may be that there is only one
           generation block for some of them.

         - 'psnGenMode': Configures the general operation mode for the agent.
           It determines the functionality, supported frame formats, protocols
           and tests. Some configuration fields defined by several OIDs defined
           in this MIB may  not be available in some configuration modes. The
           operation mode usually involves automatic re-configuration of all the
           available test ports in the agent.

         - 'psnGenControl':This OID can be used by the manager to decide how
           traffic generation is controlled. There are two possibilities,
           'custom' generation leaves the manager with full control about
           traffic generation, on the other hand, 'external' generation can be
           used to leave traffic generation to an application other than the
           default traffic generator.

         Tables
         
         - 'psnGenModeTable': This table can be used for test port management in
           the agent. It contains one row per each test port and it can be used
           to enable or disable the ports, configure them in different operation
           modes and  set their basic transmission parameters such as addresses
           and default encapsulations assigned to them. Port modes available
           depend on the global operation mode configured with 'psnGenMode'. The
           port mode configured in this table, also may enable or disable
           different configuration settings in this or other tables.

         - 'psnGenPatternTable': This is a table that enables the manager to
           select between different bit patterns to be used in L1 BER tests.
           The advantage of L1 test patterns is that they are processed as a
           byte stream by the analyser (as opposed to a frame sequence). The
           result is a more accurate description of the transmission performance
           in terms of bit errors. On the other hand, L1 test patterns do not
           contain source and destination addresses or CoS labels to force the
           stream to follow an specific path in the network. Moreover, there is
           not a 'bandwidth profile' you can use with L1 patterns, they are just
           byte sequences. At best, when they are carried within an Ethernet
           envelope, they use the  whole capacity in the transmission interface.

         - 'psnGenEthTable': This is a table that enables the agent to generate
           custom Ethernet frames in each of the available traffic generation
           blocks. Most of the Ethernet frame fields are available for
           configuration in through this table. Before configuring the fields,
           it is necessary to tell to the agent which frame structure is going
           to be used for traffic. This is done through the 'psnGenEthFrameType'
           and the 'psnGenEthEncapsulation' OIDs. Once the frame structure is
           decided, the manager has to set both the value for the different
           frame fields and the frame length. All three different settings
           (framing, frame fields values, and frame length configuration) are
           available from this table. Ethernet frame generation requires the
           global mode 'psnGenMode' to be configured to 'ethEndpoint' or
           'ipEndpoint'.

         - 'psnGenIpMplsTable': This table configures the IP / MPLS label stack
           in a traffic generation block associated with a test port or traffic
           stream. IP / MPLS is a technology that implements transmission based
           on virtual circuits in IP networks. MPLS virtual circuits, known as
           Label Switched Paths (LSPs) enable the network administrators to
           build advanced traffic engineering mechanisms in their domains.
           Another advantage,of MPLS is that it speeds up IP packet switching in
           routers by separating the functions of route selection and packet
           forwarding into two planes. Currently, there are several MPLS flavours
           and profiles available with different applications. For example
           pseudo-wire technology use an specific MPLS encapsulation without IP
           and MPLS-TP is designed to be used in packet-switched transport
           networks and replace TDM technologies like PDH and SDH. This table
           is, up to some point, independent of the MPLS flavour and it has been
           written with the original RFC 3031 specification in mind. The label
           format is specified in RFC 3032. Generation of IP / MPLS traffic
           requires 'psnGenMode' to be configured to 'ipEndpoint'.

         - 'psnGenIpTable': This table enables configuration of the IPv4
           datagram in test ports or any traffic generation block. IPv4 is
           Layer 3 protocol that enables communication with remote networks. The
           table includes configuration of the UDP protocol which operates at
           the transpoprt layer or Layer 4. Without a Network layer, all the
           Ethernet traffic generated by the agent would be unable lo leave the
           local network and reach remote networks. The Network Layer, or Layer
           3, provides end-to-end connectivity between stations that can use
           heterogeneous underlying technologies and they are not necessarily
           attached to the same network. Routers are devices that are designed
           to manage Layer 3 protocols and they implement data forwarding based
           on routing tables. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the most popular
           Layer 3 protocol. It was conceived by the U.S. Department of Defence
           (DoD) during the cold war to facilitate communication between
           dissimilar computer systems and it is a reliable technology. IP
           interconnects public or private autonomous systems providing a
           connectionless service. There are two IP protocol versions (IPv4 and
           IPv6). IPv4 addresses can be defined as a subset of the IPv6
           addressing space but IPv4 and IPv6 can be regarded as different and
           incompatible network protocols in any other sense. The 
           'psnGenIpTable' is compatible with version four of the IP protocol
           (IPv4). The correct value of 'psnGenMode' for IPv4 packet generation
           is 'ipEndpoint'. IPv4 traffic generation requires the user to set the
           lower transmission layers in the protocol stack, including the
           physical and MAC layers.

         - 'psnGenBandwidthTable': In the same way that 'psnGenEthTable' and
           'psnGenIpTable' configure the information structure and header
           content for each available traffic generation block,
           'psnGenBandwidthTable' sets how many frames are transmitted and
           how transmission events are distributed in time.  The simplest is
           to generate frames with a constant bit rate specified in frames
           per second, bits per second or as a percentage of the total
           transmission channel capacity.  As an alternative, the
           'psnGenBandwidthTable' enables the manager to configure more
           advanced generation profiles including periodic burst generation,
           ramp generation or random transmission with Poisson statistics.

         - 'psnGenPayloadTable': This table configures the payload format and
           content of traffic internally generated by the agent. Most of the
           agents with traffic generation capabilities generate synthetic
           payloads with different formats that enable them to carry out
           different kinds of measurements including Bit Error Rate (BER), 
           latency, frame loss and various other derived metrics.

         - 'psnGenLoopbackTable': The 'psnGenLoopbackTable' configures the
           traffic reflector function avaiable in some agents. When the loopback
           mode is configured in the agent the traffic it receives is forwarded
           toward their originator. This is very useful in many test and
           measurement applications where the traffic generator is waiting to
           receive the test traffic so that it can correlate the frames with
           the original ones.

EndpointMode ::=TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Encodes the different operation modes that may be supported by the
         agent. The available global operation modes are:

         - 'l1endpoint': This is a mode specifically conceived for physical
           layer BER tests. When the agent is configured in this mode is
           unable to generate user-configurable frames but it can still
           generate and analyse the PCS codes required for BER testing at L1.

         - 'ethEndpoint': If the agent is configured in Ethernet endpoint mode,
           then it emulates an Ethernet network terminating point. In this mode
           the generator sends a test signal made up of Ethernet frames to the
           DUT / SUT and the analyser receives new Ethernet frames from the DUT
           / SUT. This mode can be used for continuity / transparency testing,
           L2-L4 BER testing and performance (SLA, eSAM, RFC 2544) measurements
           in Ethernet interfaces. You can use this operation mode if you have
           IP over Ethernet but you don't care about the network protocol used
           in the network.

         - 'ipEndpoint': If the tester is configured in IP endpoint mode, then
           it emulates an IP network terminating point. In this mode the
           generator sends a test signal made up of IPv4 frames to the DUT /
           SUT and the analyser receives new IPv4 / IPv6 frames from the DUT /
           SUT. This mode is used for continuity / transparency testing, BER
           testing and performance (SLA, eSAM, RFC 2544) measurements in IP /
           Ethernet interfaces.

         - 'external': This operation mode enables the agent to implement
           external operation modes. These modes are beyond this MIB and may
           correspond to different specific measurements like cable testing,
           advanced protocol generation, traffic replay or any other.
           
         Note that this OID is deprecated, as the main mode of operation
         must be selected in the 'mfFuncTable' defined in the
         ATSL-MULTIFUNCTION-MIB.  Setting the operation mode directly in
         this OID may result in an inconsistent behaviour of the agent,
         especially in those testers that implement multiple functions,
         apart from the PSN function."

    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Configures the operation mode for the test port. The operation mode
         specifies the functions allowed for that specific port including,
         data transmission, data reception, data forwarding or any other
         permitted for the current configuration options. Only a reduced set
         of configuration options may be available in some ports or some agents:

         - 'disabled': Both the port transmitter and receiver are disabled.
           Use this mode if you are not going to use the corresponding port and
           you want to extend the operation time with batteries in the managed
           entity to the maximum

         - 'txrx': Both transmission and reception are enabled in the port. The
           transmitter is connected to the internal test traffic generator. This
           is the port mode to be used most of the times for testing in endpoint
           mode.

         - 'monitor': The port is configured in promiscuous monitoring mode and
           the port transmitter is disabled. All kinds of traffic generation
           are disabled in Monitor mode but the equipment can still reply to
           some ARP and ICMP requests for technical reasons. Use this mode if
           you want to get statistics about the network traffic, including
           traffic from remote test ports units but you don't want to disturb
           the network with any test traffic internally generated by the unit.

         - 'loopback': The port receiver is connected to the transmitter so that
           part or all the received frames are sent towards the origin. This
           port mode is used guarantee the continuity of the test payload or
           pattern to in two-way tests.

         - 'cable': This is a mode specifically used for cable tests. It is used
           if 'psnGenMode' is configured to execute a cable test. The Cable test
           port mode disables transmission of Ethernet frames or IP packets. The
           'link' port mode is not directly available for configuration. It is
           automatically configured when the global operation mode of the agent
           is configured to execute cable tests.

         - 'link': This is a mode specifically used for cable tests. It may be
           used by some test ports when 'psnGenMode' is set to execute a cable
           test in the managed entity . The 'link' port mode disables
           transmission of Ethernet frames or IP packets. The only function of
           the Link port mode is to supply link to enable other ports to measure
           the all cable parameters. The 'link' port mode is not directly
           available for configuration. It is automatically configured when the
           global operation mode of the agent is configured to execute cable
           tests."

        "This table configures the IP / MPLS label stack in a traffic generation
         block associated with a test port or traffic stream.

         IP / MPLS is a technology that implements transmission based on virtual
         circuits in IP networks. MPLS virtual circuits, known as Label Switched
         Paths (LSPs) enable the network administrators to build advanced
         traffic engineering mechanisms in their domains. Another advantage,of
         MPLS is that it speeds up IP packet switching in routers by separating
         the functions of route selection and packet forwarding into two planes.
         
         Currently, there are several MPLS flavours and profiles available with
         different applications. For example pseudo-wire technology use an
         specific MPLS encapsulation without IP and MPLS-TP is designed to be
         used in packet-switched transport networks and replace TDM technologies
         like PDH and SDH. This table is, up to some point, independent of the
         MPLS flavour and it has been written with the original RFC 3031
         specification in mind. The label format is specified in RFC 3032.

    STATUS            current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This table enables configuration of the IPv4 datagram in test ports or
         any traffic generation block. IPv4 is Layer 3 protocol that enables
         communication with remote networks. The table includes configuration
         of the UDP protocol which operates at the transpoprt layer or Layer 4.

         Without a Network layer, all the Ethernet traffic generated by the
         agent would be unable lo leave the local network and reach remote
         networks. The Network Layer, or Layer 3, provides end-to-end
         connectivity between stations that can use heterogeneous underlying
         technologies and they are not necessarily attached to the same network.
         Routers are devices that are designed to manage Layer 3 protocols and
         they implement data forwarding based on routing tables.

         The Internet Protocol (IP) is the most popular Layer 3 protocol. It was
         conceived by the U.S. Department of Defence (DoD) during the cold war
         to facilitate communication between dissimilar computer systems and it
         is a reliable technology. IP interconnects public or private autonomous
         systems providing a connectionless service. There are two IP protocol
         versions (IPv4 and IPv6). IPv4 addresses can be defined as a subset of
         the IPv6 addressing space but IPv4 and IPv6 can be regarded as different
         and incompatible network protocols in any other sense. The
         'psnGenIpTable' is compatible with version four of the IP protocol
         (IPv4). 

         The correct value of 'psnGenMode' for IPv4 packet generation is
         'ipEndpoint'. IPv4 traffic generation requires the user to set the
         lower transmission layers in the protocol stack, including the physical
         and MAC layers."

        "Configures the traffic shape to be used by the traffic generator in the

         supported:

         - 'disabled': No frames are transmitted in the current stream. Use this
           setting if you want to disable traffic generation in the current
           traffic generation block but you don't want to globally disable
           generation in the test port.

         - 'continuous': Frames are transmitted at a constant speed to match a
           value configured in bits per second, frames per second or a
           percentage of the line capacity.

         - 'burst': Traffic generation is distributed in periodic bursts of
           fixed length. Between traffic bursts the user may choose to generate
           background traffic or disable traffic generation.

         - 'ramp': Generates traffic that increases its bit rate with time in
           steps. The number of steps and step duration are configured by the
           user. Minimum and maximum traffic generated in the ramp are user
           configurable as well. Ramp generation is periodic. The traffic
           generator is restarted when it finishes with the last step of an
           specific ramp.

         - 'random': The number of frames generated per time unit is a Poisson
           random variable. This is equivalent to say that the distance between
           two consecutively generated frames is an exponential random variable.
           Use the Random generation profile to generate traffic that resembles
           network traffic as much as possible."
