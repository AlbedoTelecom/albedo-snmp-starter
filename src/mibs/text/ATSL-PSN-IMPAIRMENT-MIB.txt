    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module contains objects suitable to control event insertion in
         ATSL equipments capable of add impairments to in packet switched
         networks (PSNs).

         With the help of this MIB module you can add impairments such as frame
         delay, frame delay variation and frame loss. The MIB module is flexible
         enough to allow impairment generation over all PSN traffic or just
         fraction of it. The way the impairment generation mechanism acts over
         fractions of network traffic is outside the scope of this MIB module.
         Traffic streams. Tables implemented here include an stream identifier
         that enable the managed entity to control to which frames impairments
         apply. The specific filtering properties of each stream must be
         defined by means some mechanism not defined in this module.

         Impairment insertion is enabled or disabled by means a single scalar
         object with a boolean value: 'psnImpEvent'. Moreover, the current MIB
         module provides support to the following impairment generation
         configuration tables:

         - 'psnImpLossTable': Enables generation of frame loss event in several
         deterministic and random modes. Including single event insertion,
         burst, periodic burst, random and two-state random insertion.

         - 'psnImpDelayTable':  Generates delay and jitter following
           deterministic or random laws. There are three different insertion
           modes for delay: deterministic, random (uniform), Random
           (exponential).

         - 'psnImpBandwidthTable': Bandwidth control blocks are useful in case
           the user is interested in simulating links of custom bandwidth
           smaller than the nominal channel capacity. Users have at their
           disposal two different bandwidth control modes through this MIB
           module. Bandwidth control by means a policing operation preserves
           data stream timing but not-conforming packets are lost. Usually,
           policing is considered best in delay sensitive applications like
           VoIP. On the other hand bandwidth control by means a shaping filter
           tends to preserve the information but it may alter the timing of the
           original data stream. Shaping uses to be the preferred bandwidth
           control mechanism in data applications.

         - 'psnImpDuplicationTable': Enables generation of duplicated frames
           over the traffic stream where this impairment block applies. There
           are two different insertion modes available: single or random. The
           second one is governed by means a duplication probability parameter.

         - 'psnImpErrorTable': Configures frame error generation within the
           managed entity. The current module revision supports two different
           frame error insertion modes: single or random. The second one is
           governed by means an error probability parameter.

         Write operations (in those objects that allow write operations) is
         possible only if impairment generation through the 'psnImpEvent'
         boolean scalar is not enabled.

    DESCRIPTION
        "- The text conventions 'TableIndex', 'TimeIntervalMicroS',
           'RatioPercentage' are now imported from the 'ATSL-MIB' module.

         - A 'RowStatus' row has been added to all impairment configuration
           tables to enable dinamic management of table rows.

         - The 'psnImpFrameErrorTable' has been renamed to 'psnImpErrorTable'."

         The available modes are:

         - 'none': Disables bandwidth control.

         - 'shapingFrame': Simulates a shaping filter. The shaping filter
           allowed to transmit one frame per each 'token' stored in its 'token
           bucket' so that the bandwidth remains within the configured limit
           expressed in frames/s. The shaping bucket is filled with new tokens
           at a constant rate to replace the ones spent in transmitted frames.
           If one packet finds no token  in the bucket then it waits in a
           temporary buffer until a token is available.

         - 'policingFrame': Simulates a policing filter. A policing filter
           is allowed to transmit one frame per each 'token' stored in a virtual
           buffer known as 'token bucket' so that the bandwidth remains within
           the configured limit expressed in frames/s. The bucket is filled with
           new tokens at a constant rate to replace the ones spent in
           transmitted frames. If one frame finds no token in the bucket when is
           going to be transmitted, then it is automatically dropped.

         - 'shapingBit': Simulates a shaping filter. The shaping filter
           is allowed to transmit one byte per each 'token' stored in its 'token
           bucket' so that the bandwidth remains within the configured limit
           expressed in bit/s. The shaping bucket is filled with new tokens at a
           constant rate to replace the ones spent in transmitted frames. If one
           packet finds not enough tokens in the bucket then it waits in a
           temporary buffer until anough tokens are available. One token is
           valid for transmission of one byte. For this reason, longer frames
           require more tokens to be transmitted and it is more likely for
           longer frames to have to wait in the temporary buffer.

         - 'policingBit': Simulates a policing filter. A policing filter
           is allowed to transmit one byte for each 'token' stored in its 'token
           bucket' so that the bandwidth remains within the configured limit
           expressed in bit/s. The shaping bucket is filled with new tokens at a
           constant rate to replace the ones spent in transmitted frames. If one
           packet finds not enough tokens in the bucket when it is going to be
           transmitted, then it is automatically dropped. One token is valid for
           transmission of one byte. For this reason, longer frames require more
           tokens and it is more likely for them to be dropped due
